## 🔧 Overview

This document explains the key parts of my Time Machine and Undoing Device (Ctrl+Z box) as shown in my machine diagram. These machines are designed for safe, targeted past-change operations with memory-aware safety systems.

## 🕰️ Time Machine – Key Components

### 1. Timeline Display Panel
- Shows current date, location, and timeline ID
- Example: "10/1/2024" on top and "12/0/28" on bottom
- Allows switching between timelines

### 2. Memory Analyzer
- Detects memory consistency across alternate timelines
- Helps identify if a change has unintended ripple effects

### 3. Target Locator System
- Precisely identifies where a specific person is in the past
- Crucial for curing Beethoven in 1796

### 4. Time Transfer Control
- Controls the moment and location of the jump
- Includes safety lockouts for unstable timelines

## ⏪ Undoing Device – Key Components

### 1. Ctrl+Z Core Logic
- Stores the most recent timeline change
- Can undo the last event with 1-tap reset

### 2. Last-In-First-Out Tracker
- Maintains order of changes to reverse properly
- Designed for disaster recovery (accidental bad timeline)

### 3. Lab Return Button
- Sends user and timeline back to original lab position
- Acts as an emergency exit

## 🧠 Interface with Brain Implants

- Implants detect if the timeline is “safe” before, during, and after machine use
- Warnings appear if the memory trace doesn’t match expected history
- In future versions, direct mind control of basic actions (safety-first)

## 💬 Status

This design is in early phase. Planning and simulations will be added as I begin Stanford-based lab work starting June 2025.

# TIMELINES.md

## 🧭 Purpose
This file tracks all timeline shifts tested or simulated during development. It includes memory consistency, observed effects, and undo attempts.

---

## 📋 Format
Each entry logs:
- Timeline ID
- Change attempted
- Effect on memory and world
- Status (Stable / Unstable / Undone)

## 🧾 Timeline Log

### Timeline ID: 10/1/2024
- **Change**: N/A (original base timeline)
- **Memory**: Clean
- **Status**: Stable

### Timeline ID: 12/0/28
- **Change**: Simulated undo of team formation delay

- **Status**: Undone (restored to 10/1/2024)

### Timeline ID: 12/4/4405
- **Change**: Alternate Beethoven rescue method tested (non-implant)

## 🔁 Undo Tracking

- Ctrl+Z restores from most recent change (last-in-first-out)
- If multiple changes made, log is reversed in order

---

## 🧠 Memory Sync Notes
Memory sync across timelines is monitored by brain implants (planned 2025 install). If memory is inconsistent after a change, the system auto-warns the team.

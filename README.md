> A public project led by an incoming 9th grader to change a real event in 1796 through physical lab work and machine design.

# TimeMachine-Summer2026

This project is the foundation of a year-long effort to build two physical devices:  
**(1) a time machine to the past** and **(2) an undoing machine (last-in, first-out)** â€” designed to safely change a real historical event.

## ðŸŽ¯ Target Goal
Cure **Ludwig van Beethovenâ€™s hearing loss in 1796** using modern implant-aided hearing technology â€” by building and testing physical machines in a lab by **Summer 2026**.

The full system will involve:
- Timeline tracking and safety detection
- Physics-based modeling of past-change mechanics
- Brain-implant interface design
- Miniature device development
- Integration with real lab equipment (Stanford, if possible)

## ðŸ§  About Me
Iâ€™m an 8th grader (incoming 9th) building toward a specific, time-sensitive research goal.  
This repository reflects the earliest phase of planning and will include:

- Planning documents
- Timeline safety diagrams
- Weekly design updates
- Physics equations used in the machine logic
- Code simulations or models (coming soon)

## ðŸ“‚ Whatâ€™s Coming
- Safety detection systems for alternate timeline protection
- Device logic for undoing recent changes (like Ctrl+Z in real life)
- Timeline logs and validation protocols
- Collaboration plans for a 10-person team (with elite implants in 2025)

## ðŸ“¬ Contact
If youâ€™re a professor, student, or physicist interested in this work, youâ€™re welcome to reach out or contribute ideas.  
This project is open to collaboration and respectful feedback.

*This is an early-stage but serious repository created as part of a real research goal. Professors' work has already been integrated into this plan. I hope to begin work in a university lab in Summer 2025, especially at Stanford.*

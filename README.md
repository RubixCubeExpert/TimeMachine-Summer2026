# TimeMachine-Summer2026

This project is the foundation of a year-long effort to build two physical devices:  
**(1) a time machine to the past** and **(2) an undoing machine (last-in, first-out)** â€” designed to safely change a real historical event.

## ðŸ”­ Goal
By summer 2026, I aim to cure **Ludwig van Beethovenâ€™s hearing loss in 1796** using modern implant-aided hearing technology â€” through a real-world lab-based project involving:

- Timeline tracking and safety detection
- Physics-based modeling of past-change mechanics
- Brain-implant interface design
- Miniature device development
- Lab integration (Stanford, if possible)

## ðŸ§  Who I Am
Iâ€™m an 8th grader (incoming 9th) working toward a clear technical and historical goal.  
This repository will hold:
- Planning files
- Machine design drafts
- Physics calculations
- Simulations or models (coming soon)

## ðŸ“‚ Whatâ€™s Coming
- Safety detection system based on alternate timeline analysis
- Undoing device design (similar to Ctrl+Z for past-change)
- Timeline logs and decision tracking
- Collaboration structure for a 10-person team

*This is an early-stage repo. I created it as part of a serious research goal and hope to join a university lab (starting June 2025) to build this physically. Professors, students, and physicists are welcome to reach out if curious.*

## 🎯 Project Goal
Build two physical machines — a Time Machine and an Undoing Device — and cure Beethoven’s hearing in 1796 using implants, by Summer 2026.

---

## 🗓️ Weekly Plan (starting June 2025)

### ✅ June 2025
- Finalize team structure (10 people)
- Build physical prototype shell of Time Machine (nonfunctional)
- Begin undoing device internal design

### ✅ July 2025
- Add memory analysis logic to prototype
- Start programming Ctrl+Z undo logic
- Design implant-based timeline safety detection

### ✅ August 2025
- Begin testing timeline logging system
- Implement lab return trigger
- Simulate timeline tracking system

### ✅ September–November 2025
- Full-scale testing of all non-hazardous components
- Begin integrating Stanford lab hardware (if allowed)
- Timeline safety logs tested

### ✅ December 2025–March 2026
- Begin core machine logic implementation (real partial functions)
- Continue alternate timeline simulation
- Finalize Beethoven 1796 plan (exact meeting location, time, implants)

### ✅ April–June 2026
- Test final machine version with undoing control
- Validate memory consistency
- Prepare real past-change operation by summer

## 📌 Notes
- Plan may adjust based on lab access
- Backup simulations will run even if lab time is delayed
